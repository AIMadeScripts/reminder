## Installation
Install the package via pip:
```
pip install hackerhelp
```

## Usage
To run the `hackerhelp` script, simply execute it from the command line:
```hackerhelp```

With no arguments provided, the script will automatically attempt to find your VPN IP address, then your public IP address, and finally your IPv4 address. It will then prompt you to enter a target IP address and target website.

Once you have entered your target information, the script will display a menu with different pentesting techniques. The menu options include documentation about each technique, along with example commands that have been updated with the IP address and website information variables for easy copy and pasting.

If you need to manually set your IP address and target information, simply select option 0 from the menu.

In the menu or submenus of the script, you can always type `shell` to launch a new terminal to copy paste some of the commands across.
